/*
In the rust implemention, `Object` type can be implemented through Enum, while in cc I have to use std::optional<std::varaint>. It is awful that my
Object type is so heavy, that is because its member, `Token` type, takes memory it should not take. In fact, since the source code is scanned into vector
of tokens, we could use its reference by wrapping it with share_ptr etc., which will reduce the additional cost. However, that is a hard work for me, meanwhile
the entire code perhaps need to be refactored. I shall probablely jump into it when I am not so busy as I am nowadays.

Well, I do have time to use smart pointer to replace those Token which should not be constructed.
